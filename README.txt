All of my code has been tested in Dbeaver and works! i ran a few simple queries
to check if the data was indeed inserted into my database and everything was golden.
I have attatched both my table creation and my data insertion in seperate files and
attatched my ERD. Below I will like the Host/Server, User & Default database, as well as the password if you would like to test yourself. DataThank you and have a good day!



Name of database: Movie_Theater

Host/Server: bubble.db.elephantsql.com

Default-Database/Username: kodwfejk
